# Day 1 Task: C Programming Basics

Test your understanding of `printf()` and `scanf()` with the following question, based on Day 1 of the C Language 3-Month Roadmap.

## Question
Write a C program to read an email address in the format `firstname.lastname@domain` and print the first name, last name, and domain separately. Use `scanf()` with appropriate format specifiers to parse the input and `printf()` to display the output.

- **Input Format**: A single line containing an email address (e.g., `john.doe@example.com`).
- **Output Format**:
  ```
  First Name: john
  Last Name: doe
  Domain: example.com
  ```
- **Constraints**: No arithmetic or conditionals allowed. Assume input is valid.
- **Solution**: [email_parser.c](../starting_day/email_parser.c)

## Competitive Programming
Solve 4 problems using `printf()` and `scanf()`:
1. **Beecrowd 1000**: Print "Hello World!". [beecrowd_1000.c](../../competitive/starting_day/beecrowd_1000.c)
2. **Hackerrank Hello World**: Print "Hello, World!". [hackerrank_hello_world.c](../competitive/starting_day/hackerrank_hello_world.c)
3. **Hackerrank Playing With Characters**: Read and print a char, string, sentence. [hackerrank_playing_with_characters.c](../competitive/hackerrank_playing_with_characters.c)
4. **Hackerrank Input and Output**: Read three integers, print as is. [hackerrank_input_output.c](../competitive/hackerrank_input_output.c)

## Instructions
- Complete tasks in 1-2 hours.
- Test code locally (e.g., `gcc file.c -o file && ./file`) or on Replit.
- Compare your solution with [email_parser.c](../starting_day/email_parser.c).
- Submit competitive solutions to Beecrowd and Hackerrank, ensuring exact `printf()` formatting.
- Commit to `C-Language-Roadmap` repository: `git add .`, `git commit -m "Day 1 tasks"`, `git push origin main`.
