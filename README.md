# tarek-C-adventure

This repository documents my 3-month journey to learn C programming, starting October 20, 2025, based on a structured roadmap. I'm using Kali Linux, Geany, and GCC to build exercises, projects, and competitive programming solutions.

## Repository Structure
- `notes/`: Summaries of K&R lessons and concepts (e.g., `week1/control_data_basics.md`).
- `exercises/`: Practice code for weekly tasks (e.g., `week1/calculator_switch.c`).
- `projects/`: Mini and advanced projects (e.g., `week10/student_management_system/`).
- `competitive/`: Solutions for Beecrowd, Vjudge, and HackerRank problems.

## Roadmap Progress [Youâ€™ll need a basic understanding of C to follow this roadmap]
- [ ] **Starting Day (Oct 20, 2025)**: C basics, program structure, printf/scanf practice.
  - [Notes](notes/starting_day/Importance_structure-c.md)
  - [Task](exercises/starting_day/Task.md)
  - [Solution](exercises/starting_day/email_parser.c)
- [ ] **Week 1**: Control structures, data types, loops, calculator.
- [ ] **Week 2**: Arrays, searching, sorting.
- [ ] **Week 3**: Strings, character handling.
- [ ] **Week 4**: Functions, recursion.
- [ ] **Week 5**: Pointers.
- [ ] **Week 6**: Structures, unions.
- [ ] **Week 7**: File handling.
- [ ] **Week 8**: Dynamic memory.
- [ ] **Week 9**: Preprocessor, macros.
- [ ] **Week 10**: Mini projects (e.g., Student Management System).
- [ ] **Week 11**: Advanced projects (e.g., Library Management System).
- [ ] **Week 12**: Revision, competitive prep.

## Setup
- **OS**: Kali Linux
- **Editor**: Geany
- **Compiler**: GCC (`sudo apt install build-essential`)
- **Git**: SSH authentication (`git clone git@github.com:tarek-alnajom/tarek-C-adventure.git`)

## Learning Resources
These are the best resources I'm using to learn C, complementing *The C Programming Language* (K&R):

- **Books**:
  - *The C Programming Language* by Kernighan & Ritchie (2nd Edition): The definitive C book, used as the primary guide for this roadmap.
  - *C Programming Absolute Beginner's Guide* by Perry & Miller: Beginner-friendly with practical examples.
  - *C Programming: A Modern Approach* by K.N. King: Comprehensive, great for in-depth understanding.

- **Online Tutorials**:
  - [Learn-C.org](https://www.learn-c.org/): Interactive tutorials for beginners, covering basics to pointers.
  - [Programiz C Tutorial](https://www.programiz.com/c-programming): Clear explanations with examples for each roadmap topic.
  - [GeeksforGeeks C Programming](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/c-programming-language/): Detailed articles on arrays, pointers, file handling, and more.

- **Video Courses**:
  - [CS50's Introduction to Computer Science](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2025/): Free Harvard course with C-focused lectures (Weeks 1-2 cover C).
  - [C Programming for Beginners (Udemy)](https://www.udemy.com/course/c-programming-for-beginners/): Practical video series for hands-on learning.
  - [TheNewBoston C Tutorials](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6gx4Cwl9DGBuKtLgPR_zWYx4jF4jL7kw): YouTube playlist with beginner-friendly videos.

- **Competitive Programming Platforms**:
  - [Beecrowd](https://www.beecrowd.com.br): Beginner-friendly problems to practice I/O, loops, and algorithms.
  - [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com): C-specific challenges with tutorials (e.g., "Solve Me First").
  - [Vjudge](https://vjudge.net): Aggregates problems from multiple platforms, great for diverse practice.

- **Documentation and Reference**:
  - [cppreference.com](https://en.cppreference.com/w/c): Authoritative C reference for standard library functions (e.g., `printf`, `scanf`).
  - [GNU C Manual](https://www.gnu.org/software/gnu-c-manual/): Official guide for GCC, useful for compilation on Kali.
