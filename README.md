# tarek-C-adventure

This repository documents my 3-month journey to learn C programming, starting October 16, 2025, based on a structured roadmap. I'm using Kali Linux, Geany, and GCC to build exercises, projects, and competitive programming solutions.

## Repository Structure
- `notes/`: Summaries of K&R lessons and concepts (e.g., `week1/control_data_basics.md`).
- `exercises/`: Practice code for weekly tasks (e.g., `week1/calculator_switch.c`).
- `projects/`: Mini and advanced projects (e.g., `week10/student_management_system/`).
- `competitive/`: Solutions for Beecrowd, Vjudge, and HackerRank problems.

## Roadmap Progress
- [ ] **Starting Day (Oct 16, 2025)**: C basics, program structure, printf/scanf practice.
- [ ] **Week 1**: Control structures, data types, loops, calculator.
- [ ] **Week 2**: Arrays, searching, sorting.
- [ ] **Week 3**: Strings, character handling.
- [ ] **Week 4**: Functions, recursion.
- [ ] **Week 5**: Pointers.
- [ ] **Week 6**: Structures, unions.
- [ ] **Week 7**: File handling.
- [ ] **Week 8**: Dynamic memory.
- [ ] **Week 9**: Preprocessor, macros.
- [ ] **Week 10**: Mini projects (e.g., Student Management System).
- [ ] **Week 11**: Advanced projects (e.g., Library Management System).
- [ ] **Week 12**: Revision, competitive prep.

## Setup
- **OS**: Kali Linux
- **Editor**: Geany
- **Compiler**: GCC (`sudo apt install build-essential`)
- **Git**: SSH authentication (`git clone git@github.com:tarek-alnajom/tarek-C-adventure.git`)
